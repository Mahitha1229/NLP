## Assignments Overview

### **Assignment 1 – Tokenizer**


### **Assignment 2 - DFA**
The objective is to design and implement a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that recognizes simplified English words according to the following rules:

- The word must start with a lowercase English letter (a–z).
- The rest of the word may contain only lowercase English letters (a–z).
- Any uppercase letters, digits, spaces, or special characters make the word invalid.

This validator accepts non-empty strings composed exclusively of lowercase English letters (a–z). It includes:

- Interactive command-line validation
- Batch testing for datasets
- DFA visualization using networkx and matplotlib
- Educational insights into automata theory
